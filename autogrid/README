Building AutoGrid from source
=============================

We suggest creating a subdirectory within the "autogrid" directory
to do the compilations in.  We suggest naming them after the computer
architecture and operating system, which we abbreviate as 'ARCHOSV'.

For ARCHOSV, substitute your
computer type and operating system version, such as "i86Linux2".
You can use any name you like; nothing in the build process depends
on the name. We suggest following these patterns:
  i86Linux2 : 32-bit Intel Linux
  x86_64Linux2 : 64-bit Intel Linux
  MacOSX : Mac OS X PPC or Intel
  i86Windows : Microsoft Windows Intel
  sun4SunOS5 : SPARC Solaris

The general process is:

 "cd" to autogrid source directory
 "autoreconf -i"
 "mkdir" and "cd" your architecture's build directory (such as x86_64Linux2)
 ../configure
 make
 make install (optional)
