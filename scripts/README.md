## amber2pdbqt

Script to convert Amber topology and coordinates files to PDBQT file for WaterKit. A suffix ```_prepared``` will be added to the output file name. If the argument ```-o``` is not defined, the output name will be the same as the input topology name. If the argument ```--pdb``` is specified, it will output also a PDB file.

```bash
$ amber2pdbqt.py -t protein.prmtop -c protein.rst7 -o protein --pdb
```

## create_grid_protein_file

Script to generate automatically the gpf file for WaterKit. Instead of specifying the center of the box ```-c```, one can passed a pdb/pdbqt file of the ligand with the option ```-l``` followed by the path of the file. The box will be centered at the centroid of the ligand. The argument ```-s```specify the dimensions of the box in Angstrom. The spacing between each grid points is 0.375 Angstrom per default. There are two different water models ```-w```: tip3p or tip5p water models.

```bash
$ create_grid_protein_file.py -r protein.pdbqt -c 0 0 0 -s 24 24 24 -w "tip3p" -o protein.gpf
```

## make_trajectory

Script to concatenate all the pdb files generated by WaterKit into a Amber trajectory (netcdf format). Additionnaly, it will create also a PDB file of the whole system (protein + max number of water molecules) and the tleap script file in order to create the Amber topology and coordinates files.

```bash
$ make_trajectory.py -r protein_prepared.pdb -w traj -o protein
```
